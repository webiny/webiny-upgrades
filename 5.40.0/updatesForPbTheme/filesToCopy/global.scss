// The existing `global.scss` file has been replaced by this file.
// Note that a backup of the existing `global.scss` file has been
// created at `global.backup.scss`. If you need to restore the
// some of the styles from the old file, you can do so manually.
// The `global.backup.scss` can be deleted once you've copied
// the styles you need from it (if any).

// Styles for the rich text editor that's used with Form Builder.

// Font used with the default theme.
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=IBM+Plex+Sans:400,500,700|Lato:400,700");

// CSS reset styles that were previously here are no longer required.
// They are now maintained internally by the Webiny team.
